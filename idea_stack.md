# Idea Stack

## Problem Statement

People performing knowledge tasks often find themselves going down
"rabbit holes" or "yak shaving" or "running of on tangents" etc.
Oftentimes it can be difficult to remember all of the ideas that were
left on the stack as one idea was transitioned to from another.
Also, if someone just walked in on the conversation it's difficult to
catch them up on what's going on and what has been going on in terms
of the active narrative.

We're interested in particular in the case where this is true for a
creative stream on a platform like Twitch where the streamer can be
navigating a lot of different ideas and users are coming and going
all the time.

## Possible solutions

## The Stack

A stack, as in the data structure, is used to store ideas as they
are set aside midflight to confront new ideas. The streamer could
use something like a commandline interface to add ideas to the stack
as this occurs. This could be tough for the streamer to actually do in
practice but maybe not. This is semi-inspired by the unix commands
`pushd` and `popd` in which file directories are pushed onto a stack
so that a user may retrace their steps through some sort of file tree
traversal.

Further, the stack could have a widget that looks like a stack of
blocks with each idea written in the box. Then perhaps people in chat
could get a snapshot view of exactly what is going on on the stream at
any given time. The last item in the stack might be a long-lived item
that persists for a large portion of one stream or even multiple streams.
